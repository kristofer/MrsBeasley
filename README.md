# MrsBeasley
cross platform (iOS and OS X) _"Interstitial Journaling"_ app

I got interested a few weeks back by Interstitial Journaling. It looked interesting enough to try.

On the concept (a simple blog piece): 
[Interstitial Journaling](https://betterhumans.coach.me/replace-your-to-do-list-with-interstitial-journaling-to-increase-productivity-4e43109d15ef)

[Google "Interstitial Journaling"](http://www.google.com/search?q=Interstitial+Journaling) to search more.

I wrote MrsBeasley to be an app where I can jot down a running dialogue
with myself about those points in my day when I **"context switch"** from one task to an entirely different one. The idea is that
it's hard to sometimes switch across, and this technique forms a bridge between the tasks, 
by getting you to articulate what/how you're going to move across. 
It's kind of a "slow down and explain yourself, Kristofer" tool.

It's basically a very simple, private, micro-blogging app. It uses iCloud (private database) as its storage.

Each entry is simple text, along with create/mod dates. You create a note, type in the dialogue, save and that's it. 
The Ledger is a list of all the entries in blog-order (reverse chron), and tapping one brings it back to the detail editor. 

There is a simple Mac OSX version too, for the desktop. Currently, I do manual reloads, 
but plan to just implement a simple notifcation scheme
through the iCloud notify stuff. 

Very simple. Not "over-styled", just what I need for this couple month experiment into *"Interstitial Journaling"*.
